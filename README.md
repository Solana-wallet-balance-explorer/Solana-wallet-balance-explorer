## Setting up Telegram Notifications

To receive Telegram notifications, input your [bot token](https://core.telegram.org/bots/tutorial#obtain-your-bot-token) and your [chat_id](https://t.me/getmyid_bot) into the 'telegram-settings.txt' file, which is located in the program folder.

## Getting Started: Download and Installation

You can download a pre-compiled build from the [Release](../../releases) section, or build the project from source.

## Building the Project: A Step-by-Step Guide

This project uses C++ and has several dependencies. We recommend using **vcpkg** to simplify the process of dependency installation.

### Installing Dependencies using vcpkg:

1.  If you donâ€™t already have it, clone the **vcpkg** repository and install it by following the instructions on the [official page](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg).
2.  After installing **vcpkg**, add it to your system's PATH environment variable.
3.  Run the following commands to install the necessary dependencies:

    -   Install **OpenSSL**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install openssl
    ```

    -   Install **nlohmann-json**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install nlohmann-json
    ```

    -   Install **Crypto++**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install cryptopp
    ```

    -   Install **libsodium**:

    ```bash
    vcpkg install libsodium
    ```

4.  Once the dependencies are installed, you can proceed with the building process.

### Building with Visual Studio:

1.  Open the project solution in Visual Studio.
2.  Ensure that **vcpkg** is integrated properly (see [integrating vcpkg with Visual Studio](https://github.com/microsoft/vcpkg#visual-studio)).
3.  Click **Build** -> **Build Solution**.
4.  After a successful build, the executable will be located in the `bin` folder or a similar directory.

### Building with Another C++ Compiler:

1.  Make sure all dependencies are installed via **vcpkg** and accessible to your compiler.
2.  Compile the project using the following command (adjust as needed for your specific compiler):

    ```bash
    g++ -o solanachecker main.cpp -lssl -lcrypto -lsodium -lcryptopp -std=c++17
    ```

## Command Line Usage

Here's how to use the program via the command line:

1.  **-s / -search**: Start a brute-force process to generate seed phrases and search for wallets that contain a balance.
2.  **-t / -track (ADDRESS)**: Start tracking a particular address. The program will monitor activity on the address.
3.  **-g / -gen (NUMBER)**: Generate the specified number of Solana wallets. The `<NUMBER>` parameter defines how many wallets you'd like to generate.
4.  **-m / -mnemonic (MNEMONIC)**: Show wallet details using the provided seed phrase. Replace `<MNEMONIC>` with the actual seed phrase.
5.  **-b / -balance (ADDRESS)**: Display the balance of a specific address on the Solana network.

## Important Considerations

-   This tool is for research purposes and should not be used for illegal activities or hacking.
-   Cryptocurrency operations carry inherent risks. Always prioritize the safety of your data and wallets.
